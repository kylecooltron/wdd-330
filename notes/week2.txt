   Summary of Week:

<b>Chapter 2 of JavaScript Ninja:</b>
It was mostly a review for me, but a few things stood out:
"A JavaScript ninja should always use hard equality when testing if two values are equal"
At work we use an extension that makes sure we always declare variable types, and expected argument types. 
This is extremely useful as it helps us reduce unexpected bugs.
It was also interesting to learn more about type coercion and null/undefined.

I'm going to try really hard this semester to use best practices. (even using semicolons if I remember)



<b>Chapter 3 of JavaScript Ninja:</b>

Usually I have had to search online every time I want to use a built in array method
 to remember what it's name is.
Hopefully I can start to remember some of these. They are extremely useful! I really like the new spread opperator!

Sets and Maps, I think there are probably quite a few instances when it is useful to store a list of unique values.
I also think it's cool that you can make a map that uses numbers as keys


<b>Chapter 4 of JavaScript Ninja:</b>

Alright so I've used .map .filter and .reduce before, but now I feel I'll be able to see more scenerios to use them.
I have been using arrow functions for a while too. Callback functions are something I use sometimes when working with API's,
but I don't really look for ways to use them to optimize my code on a day to day basis. I'll start looking for
more ways to utilize them.

   Questions:

I want to learn more about common situations when you would use different data structure types.
