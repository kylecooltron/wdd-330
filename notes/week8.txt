<h2> NOTES </h2>

<em>_________________________________________
   Summary of Week:  
</em> 


I've used translate a number of times when centering things or doing weird
stuff with popups.

I want to learn more about matrix transforms and how to make subtle but 
interesting styles on my pages.

Remember: transforms don't work on inline elements.

I've used transitions before and am fairly familiar with it.
I used animation and transform in a little test project in 
the Week 8 folder so I could expirement with extending
an arm outward, rotating it, and then sticking another elements
at the end of that rotating arm that rotates itself. It was
a success! (Although the code is pretty messy).

I messed around with the Canvas tag and got it to draw colorful lines when you click on it. 

I'm excited to see what the next big project is for this class.

   Questions:  
</em>  

Is the OpenGL stuff for browsers difficult to implement?  How hard would it be just to put a spinning model somewhere on the page?


<em>_________________________________________
   Goals:  
</em> 

I want to expirement with apply translations in a certain order.
In fact, I think I'll go make a page right now and mess with that.

I really like this visual representation of bezier curves
used for timing:

<small> REMEMBER:
"If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name.
You want to avoid accidentally using any animation property key term such
as forwards, running, or alternate"</small>
