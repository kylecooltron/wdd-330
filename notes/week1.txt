<h2> NOTES </h2>

<em>_________________________________________
   Summary of Week:  
</em> 

I did the practice project in Web Stuff & Things - local storage
It was really easy. I want to learn more about local storage.


<em> Sitepoint Videos </em>
I really liked the Sitepoint videos about Mobile UX.
It opened my eyes to a few things I can keep in mind that will make users experience on my web projects smooth and easy (Ex: reachability).
I want to think about what the user most likely wants to acheive on my site,
 and eliminate unneccesary steps, as well as making icons, 
buttons, labels, etc. clear and simple.

I also want to use SVG graphics this semester.
I've never put my nav bar at the bottom of the screen.

VIDEO SUGGESTIONS:
- [MENU]
- Labels inside text fields, make fields taller, labels move to top of field,
- only display form fields that are necesary, hide unused form fields
- paginate forms that are large, autocomplete, progress
- show passwords by default
- display number keyboard on mobile if only asking for numbers
- make phone numbers a link

   Questions:  
</em>  

What kind of limitations does localStorage have? Size limit?
   Anwer from Google search:
   LocalStorage should be avoided because it is synchronous and will block the main thread. It is limited to about 5MB and can contain only strings.
