   Summary of Week:  
</em> 

I did the practice project in Web Stuff & Things - local storage
It was really easy. I want to learn more about local storage.


<em>_________________________________________
   Questions:  
</em>  

What kind of limitations does localStorage have? Size limit?
   Anwer from Google search:
   LocalStorage should be avoided because it is synchronous and will block the main thread. It is limited to about 5MB and can contain only strings.
