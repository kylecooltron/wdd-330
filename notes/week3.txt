<h2> NOTES </h2>

<em>_________________________________________
   Summary of Week:  
</em> 

<b> Object Methods: this / Chapter 5 - objects </b>
I was impressed to learn that this can be used inside functions that
do not belong to any specific object/class without throwing an error.
I need to keep in mind that arrow functions reference the outer this.

Example of object method:
<div class="code-box" >
let fish = {
   species: "Brown Trout",
   weight_lbs: 3.25,

   eatFood(){
      fish.weight_lbs += 0.1;
   }
}
</div>

I found the ES6 way of assigning properties to existing variables by
only writing the name itself pretty interesting.
I'm also wondering what uses I might find out of being
able to construct property names using expressions.

This is the best article I've ever read about regex expressions.

DANG! I never knew that some built-in functions accept regex as arguments.
Replace, split, etc. will be even more useful using regex.

<b> Chapter 6 - DOM </b>
<div class="code-box" >
document.images
</div> 

I didn't know you could get a list of all images on the page that easily.

getComputedStyle seems useful for copying and modifying

<b> Chapter 7 - Events </b>

I want to remember that I can remove event listeners.
I've used:
<div class="code-box" >
event.preventDefault();
</div> before, but I don't remember why. I think I was doing
something weird with a form. Possibly with react/PHP.

I'm trying to think of a scenerio where "capturing" would be neeful.

Okay... <h2>Event Delegation</h2> is awesome!
I could have used that in my recent project and it would have made life way more simple.

<b> Code Sandbox 14. DOM</b>
so I didn't realize that you could use recursion to make something
keep running (cat animation for example) without breaking
the rest of the website. Javascript is cool!!

   Questions:  
</em>  

How slow is Javascript? It is a really cool language, and they
seem to keep updating it with tons of features. 
I'm just wonding if a Javascript heavy site ends up being too
slow for people with bad connections. I like the idea of making
websites super interactive, and eventually designing web-apps.

REMEMBER objects are assigned by reference ( to clone use structuredClone() )
