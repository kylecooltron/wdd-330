<b> Object Methods: this / Chapter 5 - objects </b>
I was impressed to learn that this can be used inside functions that
do not belong to any specific object/class without throwing an error.
I need to keep in mind that arrow functions reference the outer this.

Example of object method:
<sub>
let fish = {
   species: "Brown Trout",
   weight_lbs: 3.25,

   eatFood(){
      fish.weight_lbs += 0.1;
   }
}
</sub>

I found the ES6 way of assigning properties to existing variables by
only writing the name itself pretty interesting.
I'm also wondering what uses I might find out of being
able to construct property names using expressions.

This is the best article I've ever read about regex expressions.

DANG! I never knew that some built-in functions accept regex as arguments.
Replace, split, etc. will be even more useful using regex.

<b> Chapter 6 - DOM </b>
document.images; I didn't know you could get a list of all images on the page that easily.

getComputedStyle seems useful for copying and modifying

<b> Chapter 7 - Events </b>
