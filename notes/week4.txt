<h2> NOTES </h2>

<em>_________________________________________
   Summary of Week:  
</em> 

 I learned more about JavaScript syntax and built-in array functions this week
 while creating the three examples for my team of how to check for wins
 in Tic-Tac-Toe.

 I was able to use what I learned last week about calling the .querySelector methods
 on an element to return results found within an elements child tree.
 This simplified clearing the Tic-Tac-Toe board:
<div class="code-box" >
    board_tds = board.querySelectorAll("td")
    for(td of board_tds){td.innerText="";}

</div>

<b> Chapter 8 - Forms </b>
I think it's really cool that you can access a form element by it's name
<div class="code-box" >
const form = document.forms.form_name;

</div>
As well as the ways I learned to access the elements in the form,
either by form.name or form.elements to get an array.

This was a good reminder about input placeholder text,
I just made a form for another class, and I should have used that to make it look cleaner.

<b> Chapter 12 - OOP </b>

Ah, I've been wondering how to do constructor functions and classes in JS.
Good to know! I'll try to start using those in the weekly projects.

Interesting that you can add more methods to built-in objects.

chaining functions is awesome.


<b> Modern Javascript </b>

I need to be better about using modules
REMEMBER export, import {} from '';

USE template files!! Super cool.

I want to learn more about deploying, transpiling, minifying..

   Questions:  
</em>  

Are we allowed to use Jquery in this class? I thought I read that we are not.
I'll double check.


<em>_________________________________________
   Goals:  
</em> 

Remember that the blur and changed events are useful for security purposes.
USE PLACEHOLDER TEXT IN FORMS! ðŸ˜‰ Simplify.
autofocus the first input on a dedicated form page to save the user time.

remember to use the [...form.powers] spread operator to turn node lists into arrays,
so you can use the array methods

You can disable the submit button with "disabled" attribute

Remember to use accessor functions and keep things private
